Summary
This project is a Node.js application that includes a basic Express server with file handling, socket communication, and integration with MongoDB. The server handles file uploads, processes user connections via Socket.IO, and interacts with a MongoDB database. It also supports basic routing, middleware for logging and error handling, and a static file server for serving client assets.

Tools & Technologies
Node.js: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server-side.
Express: A web framework for Node.js used to create the server and manage routing.
Multer: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data, used for file uploads.
Socket.IO: A library for enabling real-time, bi-directional communication between clients and servers.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store application data.
Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, used to interact with the database.
HTTP: The protocol used for serving web content and handling API requests.
dotenv: A module used to load environment variables from a .env file.
Path: A core Node.js module for working with file and directory paths.
File System (fs): A core Node.js module for interacting with the file system, used for file creation, reading, and writing.
Concepts
File Handling: The application handles file uploads using Multer, and file operations like creating, reading, and writing files using the fs module.
Real-time Communication: Socket.IO is used to enable real-time communication between the server and connected clients, allowing for instant messaging and updates.
Middleware: Custom middleware is used for logging requests and handling errors throughout the application.
Environment Configuration: The application uses dotenv to manage configuration settings through environment variables, keeping sensitive information like database credentials secure.
RESTful API: The application exposes a simple RESTful API for handling file uploads and dynamic routes.
Features
File Uploads: Users can upload files to the server, which are then stored in a designated uploads directory.
Real-time Chat: The application supports real-time messaging between connected clients using Socket.IO.
File Handling Routes: The server includes routes for creating, writing, and reading files dynamically based on user input.
Static File Serving: The server serves static files from the public directory, allowing for easy hosting of client-side assets like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Database Connection: The application connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, enabling data persistence and retrieval.
Logging & Error Handling: Custom middleware is used to log all incoming requests and handle errors consistently across the application.
